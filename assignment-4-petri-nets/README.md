# Petri Nets

This directory pertains to the fourth assignment about petri nets for the MOSIS course. 
You can find the original assignment in html format, as well many of the code, test and example files linked to by the assignment, in the `assignment-files` subdirectory ([here](/assignment-4-petri-nets/assignment-files/)). Though inclusion of these files inflates the size of the repo, we believe all required files should be available upon cloning.

# TAPAAL binaries

We provide the binaries of TAPAAL that we used to solve this assignment in this git repo as `.zip` files. They are located in the [assignment-files directory](/assignment-4-petri-nets/assignment-files/). **However**, these binaries are *included in the `.gitignore`* file of the assignment 4 directory, to reduce the size of the initially cloned repo.

# Assignment Requirements

This assignment should make use of [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/).
