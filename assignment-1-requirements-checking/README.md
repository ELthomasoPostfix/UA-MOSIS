# Requirements Checking

This directory pertains to the first assignment, requirements checking for the MOSIS course. You can find the original assignment in both html and pdf formats, as well many of the code, test and example files linked to by the assignment, in the `assignment-files` subdirectory ([here](/assigment-1-requirements-checking/assignment-files/)). Though inclusion of these files inflates the size of the repo, we believe all required files should be available upon cloning.
