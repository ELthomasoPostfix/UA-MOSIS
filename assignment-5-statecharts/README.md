# Statecharts

This directory pertains to the fifth and penultimate assignment about Statecharts for the MOSIS course. 
You can find the original assignment in html format, as well many of the code, test and example files linked to by the assignment, in the `assignment-files` subdirectory ([here](/assignment-4-petri-nets/assignment-files/)). Though inclusion of these files inflates the size of the repo, we believe all required files should be available upon cloning.
