# Statecharts
This directory pertains to the fifth and penultimate assignment about Statecharts for the MOSIS course. 
You can find the original assignment in html format, as well many of the code, test and example files linked to by the assignment, in the `assignment-files` subdirectory ([here](/assignment-5-statecharts/assignment-files/)). Though inclusion of these files inflates the size of the repo, we believe all required files should be available upon cloning.


# Assignment Requirements
This assignment should make use of [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/).


# Project directory
Our submission archive is structured as follows:
- `/assignment-files/`: Assignement description, and provided images and scripts
- `/attachments/`:  Contains the generated SVGs from all statecharts
- `/statechart/`: Contains the starting point code with all solutions
- `/report/`: Folder that contains the report(s)
